# Image-Processing-Software-IMPROSO

Welcome to IMPROSO

This is an image processing software. It is created by using Matlab GUI in order to show frequently used image denoising types. Our software three main parts which are basic operations, advance operations and image denoising. We just focus on grey-scale images in IMPROSO but if you want to use template of a colorful image, you would use change color button after import a picture. Advance operations are only for original one. If you decide to use denoising methods, you will add Gaussian noise by clicking only once to check box. When entering value, decimal ones should be look like 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 â€¦ etc. Reset button clear the modified area so you do not need to close IMPROSO to look all methods. All buttons are perfectly work but kernel regression take some time to complete process. After clicking to kernel regression, please wait. I hope it will help researchers about denoising.

Have fun

Regards
